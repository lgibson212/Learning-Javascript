vampire numbers kata
level 7

Description:
Our loose definition of Vampire Numbers can be described as follows:

6 * 21 = 126
# 6 and 21 would be valid 'fangs' for a vampire number as the 
# digits 6, 1, and 2 are present in both the product and multiplicands

10 * 11 = 110
# 110 is not a vampire number since there are three 1's in the
# multiplicands, but only two 1's in the product
Create a function that can receive two 'fangs' and determine if the product of the two is a valid vampire number.


My Solution with notes:

var vampire_test = function(a, b) {
	//both a and b need to be in individual integers/strings; product as well
  var product = (a*b);
  var A = a.toString().split("");
  var B = b.toString().split("");
  var arrayProduct = product.toString().split("").sort();
  
  //both a and b factors into a single array, sorted
  var arrayFactors= A.concat(B).sort();
  
  //need to make arrays back into string in order to compare the elements directly
  
  console.log(arrayFactors);
  console.log(arrayProduct);
 
	if(arrayFactors.toString() === arrayProduct.toString()){
		return true
	}
		else {
			return false;
		}
}
 
  
vampire_test (6, 21);
