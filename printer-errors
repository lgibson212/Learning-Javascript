printer errors kata
level 7

description:
In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.

The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, then one time color a...

Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm.

You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will output the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.


My Notes:
count the length of the string, push as denominator
count the number of errors, push as numerator

var numerator = matches.length;

errors.push (numerator + ... )

cannot read property .length of null


My Solution:

function printerError(s) {

	var matches = s.match(/[n-z]/g);
	var denominator = s.length;
	var errors = [];

if (matches === null) {
  return "0/" + denominator}
 
else {
 errors.push(matches.length + "/" + denominator);
	return errors.toString();
  }
}

printerError(s);
